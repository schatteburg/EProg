You don't have to define the width of the card during execution time.
Additionally, if you want to change the width you only have to change the variable in the code instead of every time when it is used.

To prevent a "messed up" business card for a name that is too long, you could include a contract in the beginning of print_card so that it requires names that are short enough.
