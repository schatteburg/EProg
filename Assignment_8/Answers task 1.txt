1.1
	Version 1:	Does what it's supposed to do, also with circular lists.
			However, the "infecting person" is gets flu last, unless it is the coworker
			of somebody else that will be reached by the coworker relation.

	Version 2:	Does what it's supposed to do, but only in non-circular lists. This is because
			before giving flu to the infecting person or it's coworker, it tries to infect
			the coworker.

	Version 3:	Partly works, with a non-recursive definition. However, for circular lists, the
			loop will not terminate.

	Version 4:	Does what it's supposed to do, in the most elegant way (infected person gets
			flu and then infects its coworker).

1.2
	Mit
		coworkers: LIST[PERSON]
	und set_flu, dann über coworkers iteriert erst p.set_flu und dann infect(p.coworkers)
